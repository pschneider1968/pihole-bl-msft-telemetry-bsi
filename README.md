I also added my list of 56 blocklists that I found on the Interwebs by craft of my Google-Fu.

Thanks to:

I will try to check for updates and new lists on a regular basis, but I can't promise anything.
As of today (Dec 16, 2022) the total number of blocked unique domains from all these lists is 5099479.

If something does not work, or you suspect false positives, check against the commonly whitelisted domains

Hope this helps...
